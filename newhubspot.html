                public websites up and running right now. And not just that — you can also peek at the underlying HTML

            <h2 class="md2_h2">HTML Websites</h2>
                <p class="md1_prgrph">HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the primary language of the World Wide Web. An
                    HTML document sets the content and structure of a web page. When you view a page in your browser, what
                    you’re looking at is your browser’s interpretation of an HTML file that was retrieved from a web server.
                    <br>HTML is almost always used in conjunction with two other front-end languages, CSS and
                    JavaScript.
                    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a rules language which controls the styling of a web page, including
                    colors, fonts, and layouts. JavaScript is a programming language that enables more complex features
                    like interactive elements and animations.
                    <br><br>
                    The latest version of HTML is HTML5. Released in 2008, HTML5 notably contained several improvements
                    to handle multimedia content like audio and video, as well as 
                    <a class="md1_link" href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/web-designer-vs-web-developer">semantically rich elements</a> 
                    to describe page structure.

                    <br>
                    Every website is written in HTML, regardless of the complexity of the site or the number of
                    technologies
                    involved. You can take any page and lift up the hood to see the HTML code, as well as the CSS and
                    JavaScript code, that make it come to life. In the next section, we’ll review some of the ways

            <h2 class="md2_h2">Ideas for HTML Websites</h2>
            <p class="md2_prgrph">To get comfortable with HTML (along with CSS and JavaScript), it’s a good idea to create a website or two
                from scratch. Even a relatively simple HTML website can teach you many of its intricacies and
                capabilities, and provides you with a solid foundation before you move on to more advanced projects.
                <br>Here are some ideas for beginner HTML websites you can try building:
                <li class="md2_listitem">
                <b>A personal website :</b> 
                <p class="md2_li_prgrph">Create a
                    <a class="md1_link" href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-personal-websites">personal site</a> that shows
                   off your resume, work experience, interests,skills, and personality. This is a project you can return to and revise over time as your skills
                   develop.
                </p>
                 
                </li>
                <li class="md2_listitem">
                <b>An informational site :</b>

                <li class="md2_listitem">

                    photo gallery, a video showcase, or a collection of your writing.
                </p>
                </li>
                 
                <p class="md2_prgrph">
                To get started creating your first HTML site, we recommend following this excellent tutorial from
                freeCodeCamp:</p>
                <br> 
                <iframe class="md2_img" width="560" height="315" style="border-radius: 1cm;"
                    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PlxWf493en4" frameborder="0"
                    allow="fullscreen,gyroscope,picture in picture,accelerometer" controls></iframe>
                <br> <br> 
                <p class="md2_prgrph"> As you grow more comfortable with HTML basics, you can begin to branch out to bolder, more
                unique design choices. But still, even elaborate websites can often be boiled down to a handful of HTML features
                working together to make a cohesive experience.
                <br>
                Next, let’s look at some examples of HTML websites that use HTML elements creatively and unpack what
                makes them tick.</p>

                <p><b>What we like :</b> Gloutir is a design and development studio based out of Houston, Texas that
                    features a vibrant, immaculately crafted website. The designers are clearly flexing their chops here
                    with impressive attention to detail and a near perfect balance of style and content.
                    <br>
                    At first glance, this site may look technically complex. However, most of the effects can be done
                    with plain HTML and CSS. While there’s an occasional JavaScript-powered effect (for instance,
                    animated text and a card slider), a lot of this site’s appeal comes down to smart choices of colors,
                    fonts, and images.

                    <b>What we like :</b>
                    Canvas is an HTML5 element that lets you draw graphics with JavaScript, opening a huge range of
                    possibilities for static and animated graphics. It’s also a big reason why Flash animation is now
                    obsolete.

                    This sampler website is a great introduction into some cool interactive effects you can achieve with
                    HTML canvas, like dragging elements that snap back into place, or guiding the movement of an element
                    by drawing with your mouse.

                    This is just the beginning of what’s possible with canvas. As we’ll see in later examples, this
                    element offers virtually endless possibilities for animated and interactive graphics. You can
                    leverage canvas to create whatever effect you need for your site, as long as you’re willing to learn
                    some JavaScript.

                <p><b>What we like :</b>Our next example is itself a showcase of design, the website for the 2021 Melba
                    Design Festival. Visitors are invited to explore the site by clicking its interactive jars, the
                    theme being that the best designs of 2021 are “preserved” for you to see.

                    Each “jar” is a canvas element containing SVGs representing different produce. Try hovering your
                    mouse around each jar and notice how they respond to the movement, as if floating in liquid.
                    <br>
                    This use of the canvas element is essentially a version of what we saw in Canvas Study, applied in a
                    clever way. It’s simple but unique, and achievable through built-in HTML technologies.

                    If you have the time, I recommend giving this experience a full watch. It’s a touching blend of

                <p><b>What we like :</b>The HTML5 video element was another major step in making HTML more robust, with
                    the goal of becoming the standard for playing video on web pages.
                    <br>
                    Today, many websites employ this element for autoplaying videos, fullscreen videos, and <a class="article_class_link"
                        href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/video-background-css">video background</a>. Take this
                    great example from Intelligent Video Solutions — its homepage meets you with
                    a full-width video background and overlays text, graphics, and a gradient to smoothly transition you
                    down the page.

                    If you want to achieve a similar effect on your site, the HTML5 video element is the best way to go.
                    It’s a much cleaner alternative to, say, an embedded iframe from YouTube on your page. For
                    accessibility reasons, it’s a good idea to let users pause videos, and also to let them choose
                    whether or not the video plays sound.

                    Caffeine Post is a post-production video studio that, as you might guess, also makes
                    great
                    use of the HTML video element. The homepage immediately confronts you with a chaotic but immersive
                    video
                    montage of the company’s work and dares you to watch more.

                    The selected works page is a series of thumbnails, each itself a video element. Hover your cursor
                    over a
                    thumbnail to watch it play in a loop and click on to watch a longer video preview with sound. Plus,
                    you
                    can filter the works by category (commercial, films, etc.).
                    <br>
                    For such an impressive website, it might seem surprising that its key features can all be made with
                    pure
                    HTML. It just goes to show how far even simple web technologies have come over the past decade.

                    Just about the entire experience is built around HTML canvas, with some JavaScript magic happening
                    in the background to make it possible. Dumpling Delivery showcases the limits of what you can

                    created by Danish videographer Nikolaj Juhlsen, drops you on the seat of a mountain bike as you’re
                    taken down treacherous trails across Europe.

                    This site is about as close as you can get to a real mountain biking experience through your

                    you don’t need crazy effects to pull off a great site.

                <p><b>What we like :</b>As we saw with the Understanding Neurodiversity website, music can add a layer
                    of emotional depth to any browsing experience. Let’s now turn to another example in which music is
                    the focus, the website for composer Ayako Taniguchi.
                    <br>
                    The HTML5 audio element allows websites to embed music and other sounds into web pages. You can also
                    set audio to play on a loop and provide controls for users to control playback of the sounds, as is
                    the case with this site.

                    <br> Each music sample is visualized with an interactive canvas background. The canvas was
                    configured to
                    react to both the music and cursor movements, giving the music more of an emotional impact than a
                    simple pause or play button.

                    One highlight of this site is its unique player interface. The progress bar is laid out in a circle
                    and the time displays as a countdown over a looping video background of a rippling globe. This
                    creates an extraterrestrial atmosphere to accompany the audio.

                    This simple concept can be translated to other kinds of websites — you could have visitors explore
